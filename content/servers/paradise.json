		"A major codebase and community, Paradise has been consistently ranked as the most populated public SS13 server. Notable things include a plethora of custom jobs and species to choose from, and a focus on a lag free experience over feature bloat. The server tries to strike a balance between calmer, more RP oriented rounds and events, and intense action packed gamemodes â€“ Without compromising the complex interactions of game mechanics. A large team of friendly mentors are available to help even the newest player quickly get on their feet."
